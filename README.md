This repository distills years of end-to-end driving research — and the lessons learned along the way — into a complete and opinionated infrastructure for imitation learning research in the CARLA simulator.

The codebase will be maintained in the coming years to support KE:SAI's open science mission, so you can expect future improvements, mostly in the form of less code, reduced complexity and improved documentation.

A short list of highlights, with comparisons against our previous [cvpr2026](https://github.com/kesai-labs/lead/tree/cvpr2026) pipeline, which builds on [carla_garage](https://github.com/autonomousvision/carla_garage) and the original [transfuser](https://github.com/autonomousvision/transfuser) codebase:

- **Fast data generator**: runs at ~10 steps/s on a consumer GPU, up to 10× faster ⚡.
- **Standardized format**: the data are readable, filterable, and visualizable with [py123d](https://github.com/kesai-labs/py123d) 🌟.
- **Efficient storage**: the full dataset fits in ~1 TB, with up to 1000× fewer files.
- **Rapid training**: TransFuser trains in under 24 h on 4×H100, more than 3× faster ⚡.
- **SoTA performance**: best driving scores on all available Leaderboard 2.0 benchmarks at release.

> \[!NOTE\]
> Branch `cvpr2026` is where we host the code, data and checkpoints for the arXiv paper. The datasets and checkpoints of the `main` branch are not compatible with the datasets and checkpoints of the `cvpr2026` branch; in fact, those two branches are completely independent. To reproduce the paper, use the `cvpr2026` branch. We recommend that future research build on the `main` branch.

Release notes:

- [v1.5.0 on Aug 20, 2026](https://github.com/kesai-labs/lead/releases/tag/v1.5.0): Released more checkpoints and [documentation](docs/speed.md) to tune the training pipeline's efficiency.
- [v1.4.0 on Aug 9, 2026](https://github.com/kesai-labs/lead/releases/tag/v1.4.0): Initial release of dataset in new format and pre-trained checkpoints.

### 🛠️ Setup for development

Grab the code:

```console
user@host:~$ git clone https://github.com/kesai-labs/lead.git
user@host:~$ cd lead
```

Set up the environment. Any conda-compatible manager works:

```console
user@host:~/lead$ micromamba create -n lead python=3.10 -y             # Create container
user@host:~/lead$ micromamba activate lead
user@host:~/lead$ pip install uv                                       # Install uv
user@host:~/lead$ uv pip install -e "." --reinstall-package lead       # Install lead and its dependencies
user@host:~/lead$ micromamba deactivate && micromamba activate lead    # Add scripts/cli to system's PATH
```

Install CARLA; version 0.9.16 is required for data collection. Evaluation works on 0.9.15, too.

```console
user@host:~/lead$ bash scripts/common/setup_carla.sh               # CARLA 0.9.16
user@host:~/lead$ bash scripts/common/setup_carla_fail2drive.sh    # Optional: Fail2Drive CARLA 0.9.15
```

If you get stuck, take a look at our [pipeline](.github/workflows/ci_e2e.yml). We dedicate a machine with GPU for testing purpose.

### 🔥 Get the data

We provide a dataset of 8,930 routes across 43 scenario types on all 12 CARLA town maps. Compared to previous TransFuser-lineage codebases, the recordings are denser (higher frequency), cover the full 360° surround view, and span more sensor modalities. See the [latest release](https://github.com/kesai-labs/lead/releases/latest) for information on how to obtain the data.

| Modality                          | Frequency | Format                                            |
| :-------------------------------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| RGB                               | 4 Hz      | JPEG, quality adapted to weather and daytime      |
| Depth                             | 4 Hz      | PNG, 8-bit linear quantization saturating at 50 m |
| Semantic segmentation             | 4 Hz      | PNG, CARLA class ids                              |
| Instance segmentation             | 4 Hz      | PNG, CARLA actor ids                              |

| Radar                             | 20 Hz     | Raw points with radial velocity                   |
| Ego states, boxes, traffic lights | 20 Hz     | Arrow tables                                      |

See [data access](docs/data_access.md) for the full stream table and the on-disk layout.

In case you want to collect the data yourself with customized sensor configurations, the expert is reasonably fast; on a modest GTX 1080 Ti and 2 CPU cores it runs at around 10 steps per second. We plan to extend the data generation pipeline with a learning-based expert in the future. To generate data on a single route:

```console
user@host:~/lead$ python -m lead --expert --routes src/lead/routes/data_routes/lead/Accident/route_001761.xml
```

Collecting the full set of routes takes less than a day on a cluster with 64 GTX 1080 Ti GPUs. See [data collection](docs/data_generation.md) for details, including how to scale the collection on SLURM.

### 💡 Read and visualize data

The logs are regular 123D data with no CARLA dependency; the entire `py123d` API works on them out of the box ✨

```python
>>> from py123d.api.scene.arrow.arrow_scene_builder import ArrowSceneBuilder
>>> from py123d.api.scene.scene_filter import SceneFilter
>>> from py123d.common.execution.thread_pool_executor import ThreadPoolExecutor
>>>
>>> scenes = ArrowSceneBuilder(
...    logs_root="data/lead/123D/logs",
...    maps_root="data/lead/123D/maps",
... ).get_scenes(
...     SceneFilter(split_names=["normal_view"]),
...     ThreadPoolExecutor(),
... )

>>> scenes[0].get_camera_at_iteration(0, "pcam_f0").image.shape
(384, 384, 3)
```

See [data access](docs/data_access.md) for documentation on the data layout, and the [notebook](notebooks/data_access.ipynb) for a worked example. To inspect data, we provide two options: you can either point the standard `py123d-viser` tool at a log and look around:

```console
user@host:~/lead$ py123d-viser 'scene_filter.split_names=[normal_view]'                          # every log in normal_view
user@host:~/lead$ scripts/cli/viser data/lead/123D/logs/normal_view/<scenario_type>/<log_name>   # open a single log
```

Or you can visualize the input features and output labels of TransFuser, using only low-level drawing libraries such as `cv2` and `matplotlib`; see this [notebook](notebooks/data_visualization.ipynb) for more details.

### 💪 Training

Before training, you can optionally run cache building, which precomputes expensive features and inputs:

```console
user@host:~/lead$ bash scripts/common/build_cache.sh   # Build ~60GB training cache
```

Its manifest stores a `cache_finger_print` of the config. If the fingerprint changes, training detects the stale cache, fails, and requests a rebuild. After the cache is built, which should take at most two hours on a modern computer, training can start:

```console
user@host:~/lead$ python -m lead.training.train training.data.read_from_cache_store=true # Start training
```

See [training](docs/training.md) for more details on training. To tune the pipeline for training throughput, see the [faster training guide](docs/speed.md).

### 🚀 Evaluation

Use your own checkpoints from `outputs/`, or download our trained ones: see the [latest release](https://github.com/kesai-labs/lead/releases/latest) for information on how to obtain them.

Evaluation drives against a live simulator, so start CARLA in a second terminal:

```console
user@host:~/lead$ scripts/cli/start_carla
```

And start the evaluation on one route:

```console
# Bench2Drive
user@host:~/lead$ python -m lead --checkpoint <checkpoint dir> --routes src/lead/routes/benchmark_routes/bench2drive/23687.xml --bench2drive

# Longest6 v2
user@host:~/lead$ python -m lead --checkpoint <checkpoint dir> --routes src/lead/routes/benchmark_routes/longest6/00.xml

# Town13
user@host:~/lead$ python -m lead --checkpoint <checkpoint dir> --routes src/lead/routes/benchmark_routes/Town13/0.xml
```

Routes for Bench2Drive, Town13, longest6, and Fail2Drive ship under `src/lead/routes/benchmark_routes/`. See [evaluation](docs/eval.md) for more information on how to scale evaluation on SLURM.
